# Created by: sources\recs\recs2020\tsv_maker.py
# Description: The presence of ducts in the dwelling unit.
# Source: The sample counts and sample weights are constructed using U.S. EIA 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.
# Assumption: Ducted Heat Pump HVAC type assumed to have ducts
# Assumption: Non-Ducted Heat Pump HVAC type assumed to have no ducts
# Assumption: There are likely homes with non-ducted heat pump having ducts (Central AC with non-ducted HP) But due to structure of ResStock we are not accounting those homes
# Assumption: Evaporative or swamp cooler assigned Void option
