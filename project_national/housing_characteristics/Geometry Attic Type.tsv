# Assumption: ResStock cannot model Finished attics, but will be able to with HPXML
# Assumption: In HPXML Geometry Stories is needed as a dependency as a 1 story unit cannot have a finished attic
# Assumption: After the transition to HPXML, finished attic distributions can be created using RECS 2015 or RECS 2009 and the ATTICFIN field
