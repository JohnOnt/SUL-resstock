1. Create resstock 'projections' branch, and clone 'projections' branch from https://github.com/NREL/resstock.git
2. Copy projection_national directory to project_national_2020
3. Replace Vintage ACS file with version that includes all vintages up to 2050
4. Create new project directories for each fifth year (2025:2060) and stock scenario (base, hi Dem Rate, hi Multifamily)
5. Run the 'HSMtoResStock.R' script, which converts housing stock scenario results into new definitions of the Vintage, Type ACS, county, and IECC Climate Zone,
first for 2020, then for all year and stock combinations
6. Run the 'CharacteristicsNewHousing.R' script, which defines housing characteristics for future cohorts. 
For HVAC Heating Type, Geom Floor Area and some other characteristics, the scenario_dependent_characteristics directory, and Unchanged, Reduced_FloorArea, Deep_Electrification subdirectories need to be created in each project folder.
7. Add new options to options_lookup: 
Vintages: from 2020s to 2050s; 
Insulation Crawlspace: "Wall R-15, Unvented";
Insulation Slab: "4ft R10 Perimeter, R10 Gap", "4ft R10 Exterior";
Insulation Finished Roof: "R-60"
Clothes Dryer: "Electric, Premium, 80% Usage", "Electric, Premium, 100% Usage", "Electric, Premium, 120% Usage", same for Gas;
8. Ensure that all vintage options exist in all files. If not this will cause some check/build jobs to fail after pushing to github
9. Add folders to contain large file outputs (e.g. buildstock.csv files), and add these folders to .gitignore to avoid issues pushing large files to github.
It is very important to add these folders to .gitignore before the large files are created, as large files will causes issues in the git repo history, and 
can make it impossible to push the repo from the local to the github remote.
10. Add the sampling_full.sh bash file and run it to create desired samples of the initial (2020) stock, and future stock scenarios
