   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 1 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** GetShadowingInput: DetailedSkyDiffuseModeling is chosen but not needed as either the shading transmittance for shading devices does not change throughout the year
   **   ~~~   **  or MinimalShadowing has been chosen.
   **   ~~~   ** Simulation should be set to use SimpleSkyDiffuseModeling, but is left at Detailed for simulation.
   **   ~~~   ** Choose SimpleSkyDiffuseModeling in the ShadowCalculation object to reduce computation time.
   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = CENTRAL AC AND FURNACE CLG COIL but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   ** Warning ** Water heater = WATER HEATER TANK:  Recovery Efficiency and Energy Factor could not be calculated during the test for standard ratings
   **   ~~~   ** Setpoint was never recovered and/or heater never turned on
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=PUMP VARIABLE SPEED 1

   **   ~~~   ** ... Possible reasons for low outlet air dry-bulb temperatures are: This DX coil
   **   ~~~   **    1) may have a low inlet air dry-bulb temperature. Inlet air temperature = 16.605 C.
   **   ~~~   **    2) may have a low air flow rate per watt of cooling capacity. Check inputs.
   **   ~~~   **    3) is used as part of a HX assisted cooling coil which uses a high sensible effectiveness. Check inputs.
   ** Warning ** GetCurrentScheduleValue: Schedule="CLOTHES_DRYER_EXHAUST" is a Schedule:File
   **   ~~~   ** ...Use of Schedule:File when DaylightSavingTime is in effect is not recommended.
