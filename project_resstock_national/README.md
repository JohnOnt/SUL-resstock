# National Project Folder

This folder contains the ResStock inputs to for the single family detached national residential building stock. The main inputs that characterize the building stock is the housing characteristics in the `housing_characteristics/` directory.  The housing characteristics  

## Visualization of the Housing Characteristic Dependencies

ResStock is built upon the conditional probabilites of the housing characteristics.  Each housing characteristic has a set of dependencies and dependants.  An interactive dependency and dependents visualization is provided in the links below:

## Visualization of the Housing Characteristics as a Graph

The conditional dependencies of the housing characteristic allow for the formulation of the housing characteristics as a directed graph (or network).  In the graph the housing characteristics are the nodes and the dependencies are directed edges.  A visualization of the noted, edges, and different levels of the graph can be seen in the `.pdf` files in the `util/dependency_graphs` directory.
