Install OpenStudio and PAT
==========================

This is necessary because the latest critical changes to run ResStock projects are only available in the latest version.
Do a default install including Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT). 

Open Parametric Analysis Tool. You may be asked if you would like to allow openstudio to allow connections. Select "Allow".
