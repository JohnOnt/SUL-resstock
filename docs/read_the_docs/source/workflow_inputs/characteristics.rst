% Area Median Income is calculated using annual household income in 2019USD (continuous, not binned) from 2019-5yrs PUMS data and 2019 Income Limits from HUD. These limits adjust for household size AND local housing costs (AKA Fair Market Rents). Income Limits reported at county subdivisions are consolidated to County using a crosswalk generated from Missouri Census Data Center's geocorr (2014), which has 2010 ACS housing unit count. For the 478 counties available in PUMS (60%), the county-level Income Limits are used. For all others (40%), PUMA-level Income Limits are used, which are converted from county-level using the spatial_tract_lookup file containing 2010 ACS housing unit count.

All mobile homes have Ambient foundations.; Multi-family buildings cannot have Ambient and Heated Basements; Single-family attached buildings cannot have Ambient foundations; Foundation types are the same for each building type except mobile homes and the applicable options.; Because we need to assume a foundation type for ground-floor MF units, we use the lumped SFD+SFA distributions for MF2-4 and MF5+ building foundations. (RECS data for households in MF2-4 unit buildings are not useful since we do not know which floor the unitis on. RECS does not include foundation responses for households in MF5+ unit buildings.); For SFD and SFA, if no foundation type specified, then sample has Ambient foundation.

Assumption
**********

Wood and Vinyl are considered same material; Triple Pane assumed to be 100% low-e; Only breaking out clear and low-e windows for the Double, Non-Metal frame type; Source of low-e distribution is based on engineering judgement, informed by high-levelsales trends observed in Ducker Worldwide studies of the U.S. Market for Windows, Doors and Skylights.; Due to low sample sizes, the following adjustments are made:; [1] Vintage data are grouped into: 1) <1960, 2) 1960-79, 3) 1980-99, 4) 2000s, 5) 2010s.; [2] Building Type data are grouped into: 1) Single-Family Detached, Single-Family Attached, and Mobile homes and 2) Multi-Family 2-4 units and Multi-Family 5+ units.; [3] Climate zones are grouped into: 1) 1A, 2A, 2B; 2) 3A, 3B, 3C, 4B; 3) 4A, 4C; 4) 5A, 5B; 5) 6A, 6B; and 6) 7A, 7B 7AK, 8AK.; [4] Federal Poverty Levels are progressively grouped together until all bins are combined.; [5] Tenure options are progressively grouped together until all bins are combined.; Storm window saturations are based on D&R International, Ltd. 'Residential Windows and Window Coverings: A Detailed View of the Installed Base and User Behavior' 2013. https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/11/f5/residential_windows_coverings.pdf. Cut the % storm windows by factor of 55% because only 55% of storms are installed year round; Due to lack of performance data storm windows with triple-pane are modeled without the storm windows; Due to lack of performance data Double-pane, Low-E, Non-Metal, Air, M-gain, Exterior Clear Storm windows are modeled as Double-pane, Clear, Non-Metal, Air, Exterior Clear Storm windows
