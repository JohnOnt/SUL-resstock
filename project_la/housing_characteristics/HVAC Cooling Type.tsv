# Created by: sources\recs\2009\tsv_maker.py
# Source: The sample counts and sample weights are constructed using U.S. EIA 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.
# Assumption: If a sample has both Central AC and Room AC, we assume it has Central AC only
# Assumption: If a sample indicates using a heat pump for AC but does not indicate using a heat pump for heating, then we either assign it a heat pump for heating (if electric heating was indicated), or we asssign it Central AC (if non-electric heating was indicated).
# Assumption: Due to low sample sizes for some Heating Types, Heating Type data for Non-Ducted Heating and None is grouped.
# Assumption: Due to low sample sizes for some Building Types, Building Type data are grouped into: 1) Single-Family Detached and Single-Family Attached, and 2) Multifamily 2-4 units and Multifamily 5+ units, and 3) Mobile Homes.
# Assumption: Due to low sample sizes for some Vintages, Vintage ACS (20-year bins) is used instead of the typical 10-year bins used for RECS data.
# Manually downselected to the ASHRAE Climate Zone 3B for Project LA
