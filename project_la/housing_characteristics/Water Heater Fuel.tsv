# Created by: sources\recs\2009\tsv_maker.py
# Source: Constructed using U.S. EIA 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.
# Assumption: Due to low samples Single-Family Detached and Mobile Home samples have been lumped
# Assumption: Due to low samples Multi-Family 2-4 and Multi-Family 5+ samples have been lumped
# Assumption: Due to low samples the Location Region dependency has been removed for Heating Fuel None
# Assumption: Due to low samples the Geometry Building Type RECS dependency has been removed for Heating Fuel Propane
# Assumption: Due to low samples the Location Region dependency has been removed for Heating Fuel Other Fuel
# Assumption: Due to low samples the Location Region dependency has been removed for Heating Fuel Fuel Oil except in CR03 and CR07 (New England and Mid-Atlantic)
# Manually downselected to Location Region CR11 for project_LA
