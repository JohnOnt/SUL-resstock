  "modeler_description": "The measure will create a new instance of the OS:WaterHeater:Mixed object. The measure will either create a new plant loop, or be assigned to an existing plant loop. The object will be configured be to use the user arguments. The EIO file (generated upon sucessful simulation) can be viewed to compare the industry standard ratings of Recovery Efficiency and Energy Factor for water heater objects as compared to the user input values for these ratings. Tankless water heaters are assumed to have 1 gallon of storage (0.00379 m^3).",
  "description": "This measure adds an OS:WaterHeater:Mixed object representing an Electric Tankless Water Heater. Users will be asked to provide 6 inputs: 1) Plant Loop Assignment; 2)Rated  Energy Factor; 3) SHW Setpoint; 4) Water Heater Capacity; 5) Water Heater Location; 6) Derate for cycling inefficiencies",
