  "modeler_description": "The measure will create a new instance of the OS:WaterHeater:Mixed object representing a Natural Gas Storage Water Heater. The object will either create a new plant loop, or be assigned to an existing plant loop. The object will be configured be to use the user arguments. The EIO file (generated upon successful simulation) can be viewed to compare the calculated industry standard ratings of Recovery Efficiency and Energy Factor for water heater objects as compared to the user input values for these ratings.",
  "description": "This measure adds an OS:WaterHeater:Mixed object representing a Natural Gas Storage Water Heater. Users will be asked to provide the following arguments: 1) Use case; 2) Number of Bedrooms; 3) Number of Bathrooms; 4) Plant Loop Assignment; 5) Tank Volume; 6) Energy Factor; 7) Water Temperature Setpoint; 8) Water Heater Location; 9) Water Heater Capacity; 10) Recovery Efficiency; 11) Heater Fuel Type ",
